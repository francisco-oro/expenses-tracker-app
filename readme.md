## Technologies

  ### Backend
  The app utilizes Django's authentication system to handle user registration, login, and logout functionalities. It incorporates various Django features such as decorators and middleware to enforce authentication and authorization rules, ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive areas of the application.

 The backend of the app leverages Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database. It efficiently retrieves and manipulates data, allowing users to view their expenses, categorize them, and set personalized preferences. The app also utilizes Django's pagination feature to display expenses in a user-friendly and manageable way. 
 
 ### Frontend
To enhance the user experience, the app utilizes HTML templates, CSS, JQuery and Bootstrap 5 for the frontend. It provides an intuitive and responsive interface that allows users to easily navigate through different sections, view expense details, and interact with the application seamlessly. 
 
In addition, the app incorporates features like data validation, error handling, and user feedback using Django's form handling capabilities. This ensures that the data entered by users is validated and processed correctly, providing a robust and secure experience. It's worth noting that this project uses Travis CI to run all the necessary tests.
